# Estimating the Crop Yield using Data Analytics

Agriculture is important for human survival because it serves basic needs. A well-known fact is that the majority of the population in India is into agriculture. Due to variations in climatic conditions, there exist bottlenecks for increasing crop production in India. It has become a challenging task to achieve desired targets in Agri based crop yield. Various factors are to be considered which have a direct impact on the production, and productivity of the crops. Crop yield prediction is one of the important factors in agriculture practices. Farmers need information regarding crop yield before sowing seeds in their fields to achieve enhanced crop yield. The use of technology in agriculture has increased in recent years and data analytics is one such trend that has penetrated into the agriculture field.In this project,IBM Cognos Analytics is used to understand and analyse various crop patterns and growth trends through dashboards that contain interactive visualizations.

## Tools Used
* IBM Cognos Analytics - for Dashboarding and Analysing.
* JIRA - for Project Management Activties and Progress Tracking

## Stages involved in the Project
* Working with the Dataset
    - Understand the Dataset
    - Loading the Dataset

* Data visualization charts

    - Seasons with average productions
    - With years usage of Area and Production
    - Top 10 States with most area
    - State with crop production
    - States with the crop production along with season
* Dashboard Creation

* Export the Analytics

## Resources

## Features

1. State Name - All the Indian State names.
2. District Name -Different District names.
3. Crop Year- contains the crop years.
4. Season â€“ Different seasons for crop production.
5. Area- Total number of areas covered.
6. Production- production of crops.

## Data Visualization Charts

* Visualizaiton to showcase Average Crop Production by Seasons.
* Yearly usage of Area in Crop Production.
* Visualization to show case top 10 States in Crop Yeild Production by Area.
* Visualization to showcase the Crop Production by State.
* Viusal analytics to represent the Sates with Seasonsal Crop Production using a Text representation.
